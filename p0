We have made progress in improving solution times for spectral element and
high-order FEM Poisson solves using $p$-multigrid (pMG) with Chebyshev-accelerated
Schwarz smoothing.  In a recent article, Lottes \cite{lottes22} demonstrated
the benefits of using 4th-kind Chebyshev polynomials for multigrid smoothing.
A particular feature of Chebyshev smoothing is that it is better able to
suppress low-wavenumber error than standard smoothing strategies.  By 
reducing the number of outer GMRES iterations, these gains in pMG
take pressure off of the coarse-grid solver, which is expensive for
large-scale simulations, particularly at exascale and beyond.  In a forthcoming
article, we demonstrate that omitting post-smoothing and using pre-smoothing
with 4th-kind Chebyshev polynomials of degree $2k$ is often superior to pre-
and post-smoothing with degree $k$.  

Table \cite{tab:cheb} summarizes the gains with this strategy for several CEED
and NekRS test cases with spectral elements of order $N=7$.  Kershaw is a
Poisson solve in the unit cube where $\epsilon=1$ implies that the mesh is a
uniform array of $E=36^3$ elements ($n=16$M), while $\epsilon \longrightarrow
0$ induces an increasing level of mesh distortion and anisotropy. The other
three cases are Navier-Stokes solutions in pebble-bed geometries that are
relevant to DOE's Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS)
project.  The number of elements for $S=67$, 146, and 1568 pebbles are
respectively $E = 122$K ($n$=42M), 62K ($n$=21M), and 524K ($n$=180M).  The
table presents the method that was found to be the fastest for each test case.
(NekRS will automatically select this method.)  The options include 1st-kind
and 4th-kind Chebyshev smoothing, with additive Schwarz (ASM) or restricted
additive Schwarz (RAS), and with polynomial smoothing of degrees $(k_d,k_u)$ on
the respective downward and upward legs of the pMG V-cycle.   $T_S$
is the solve time and $T_D$ is the solve time for the default
NekRS solver.  Also indicated are the gains in the coarse-grid solve times.
The results show that the one-sided smoothing is not always the fastest
(which is supported by our analysis), but that it does pay off for challenging
mesh configurations.  Overall, the gains are anywhere from 17 to 81\% over the
Chebyshev-accelerated Schwarz smoothing cycle that is the current default in
NekRS.
