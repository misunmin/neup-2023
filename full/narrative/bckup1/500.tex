The objective of this project is to develop reduced-order models (ROMs) that will improve the accuracy of LMR system-level analysis with low overhead. These new models will systematically mine high-fidelity DNS, LES, or uRANS simulations to construct low-order dynamical systems that can be couple with a systems analysis code such as the SAM code being developed under NEAMS. The ROM will be developed as a new software module in the NEAMS-supported Nek5000 thermal-fluids code.
