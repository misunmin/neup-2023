%% In the attached schedule, we note the early start for several of the FOM/ROMs.
%% In particular, we intend to start the target upper plenum FOM/ROM in the first
%% six months because observation of its behavior will guide subsequent design
%% choices in developing the QOIs and input-parameter options.
%%    The baseline simulations (3D hydro, 2D+thermal, 3D+thermal) will follow
%% a more sequential path, with algorithmic developments for each case being
%% built on the developments of the preceding one. 
%%    Formulation of QOIs also implies development of accompanying 
%% online error indicators.



The tasks proposed to realize a multiscale simulation capability within
Nek5000/RS/ROM for reactor analysis were described in the \textit{Logical Path}
section.  A schedule for these tasks is provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:gantt}. \\[-1ex]
